## http server
[x] build it from scratch
[x] sys calls
[x] how fast should it actually be from first principles?
    - baseline
    - startup time, size, memory footprint, tps
[x] http 1.1 protocol write up
    - pipeline desyncing
    - hol blocking
    - connection round trips
    - tcp slow start
    - text based protocol vs binary
    - sequential parsing
    - http 1.1 / 2 Austin. springboot slow
[] http 1.1 java
[] http 1.1 kotlin
[] http 2
[] UDP / http 3 / QUIC
[] controllers / middleware / serializers / config
    - compared to spring boot?

## JSON parsing
[] JSON investigation
    - text vs binary protocols
    - stack frame mem overflow - QTA
