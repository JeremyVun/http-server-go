1. Http 1.1 schema

2. round trips
    1 TCP
    2 SSL
    x http

2. Keep alive
    - head of line blocking!
    - misconfigured content-length. messes up all further reads
    - terrible protocol. over/under send issue. Have to close connection and re-establish
        - at worst, we could potentially cause memory overflow
        - It wil throw on a perfectly fine connection, not the misbehaving one
    - quick search. security vulnerability.
        - disable pipelining
        - I can send more bytes (my malicious request), and under specify the content-length
        - it is fundamentally flawed
        - http request smuggling

    - Jmeter sends this header. How can we stop it?
        - every second request fails
        - Send connection: close
3. pipelining has huge benefits
    - when not cpu blocked on requests using simple HelloHandler
4. pipelining and head of line blocking
